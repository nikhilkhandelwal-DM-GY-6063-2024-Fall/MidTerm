// Pseudo-code for Global Variables
- Define a variable for the sun's vertical position (sunY)
- Define a variable for Simba's abstract shape size (simbaSize)
- Create an array to store star information (stars)

// Setup Function
function setup():
  - Create a canvas with window width and height
  - Initialize sunY to start at the bottom of the canvas (height)
  - Initialize simbaSize to a default small size (cub state)
  - Create 100 stars with random positions, sizes, and brightness, and add them to the stars array

// Draw Function
function draw():
  - Set a black background
  - Call function to draw the rising sun
  - Call function to draw Simba's abstract shape
  - Call function to draw the twinkling stars

// Function for the Rising Sun
function drawSun():
  - Set sun color using a gradient (lerpColor)
  - Draw the sun as an ellipse at the center of the canvas (width/2, sunY)
  - If sunY is greater than halfway up the canvas (height/2), reduce sunY to create a rising effect

// Function for Simba's Abstract Shape
function drawSimbaShape():
  - Draw an ellipse at the center of the canvas with current simbaSize
  - Change color and size based on simbaSize variable

// Function for Drawing Stars
function drawStars():
  - Loop through the stars array
    - Set star color based on its brightness
    - Draw each star as an ellipse at its position

// Mouse Pressed Function
function mousePressed():
  - Placeholder for ripple effects (to be implemented later)
  - Logic to create expanding circles at mouse position

// Key Pressed Function
function keyPressed():
  - If key '1' is pressed, set simbaSize to a small value (cub)
  - If key '2' is pressed, set simbaSize to a medium value (adolescent)
  - If key '3' is pressed, set simbaSize to a large value (adult)
