# Mid-Term Project: Interactive Poster - The Lion King

## Project Overview
This project is part of my mid-term assignment, where I am creating an interactive and time-based digital poster inspired by Disney’s *The Lion King*. The poster combines technical skills with creative design, showcasing themes from the movie using programming structures such as loops, objects, arrays, and conditional statements.

## Project Details
### Movie Chosen
- **Title:** *The Lion King*
- **Description:** 
  *The Lion King* is a Disney animated film that follows Simba, a young lion prince, as he struggles to accept his role as the rightful heir to the Pride Lands after the tragic death of his father, Mufasa. The story is one of self-discovery, redemption, and the "circle of life," emphasizing themes like family, leadership, and courage.

## Aspects Included in the Poster
- The interactive poster will depict central themes and scenes from the movie, such as:
  - **The “Circle of Life” sunrise scene**, symbolizing renewal and the progression of life.
  - **Pride Rock silhouette**, representing Simba's journey to the throne.
  - **Simba’s transformation from cub to king**, illustrating his character growth.
- The cover will utilize circular shapes to represent the "circle of life," emphasizing the film’s core themes.

## Interactivity and Time-based Elements
- **Time-based Elements**:
  - The sun will rise gradually in the background, representing the passage of time and the theme of growth in the movie.
- **Interactive Features**:
  - **Mouse Events**: Clicking the mouse will trigger changes in the scene, such as Simba’s appearance on Pride Rock or a ripple effect that symbolizes impact and change.
  - **Keyboard Events**: Different stages of Simba’s life (cub to adult) will appear based on the keys pressed, symbolizing his character development.

## Ideas to Explore/Experiment With
- **Custom Functions**: 
  - To animate the sun’s ascent and other moving elements, such as birds flying across the scene.
- **Arrays**:
  - To create stars that appear randomly and fade in the night sky, adding to the dynamic nature of the poster.
- **Objects/Classes**:
  - Characters like Simba, Nala, or Mufasa will be represented using objects or classes, with different visual states that change based on user interaction.
- **Loops**:
  - To generate repetitive patterns, such as the waves of grass in the savannah.
- **If() Statements**:
  - To trigger changes based on user input or elapsed time, such as transforming Simba from a cub to a fully-grown lion.

## Connections to Readings
- The use of programming structures like loops, objects, and arrays aligns with our readings on interactive design.
- The focus on interactive and time-based design draws from discussions on how users engage with digital narratives, ensuring that elements of the story are represented through interaction.

## Sketch
- The attached sketch includes the proposed design elements:
  - **Top Section**: Rising sun over Pride Rock.
  - **Middle Section**: Simba’s transformation stages.
  - **Bottom Section**: Waves of grass in the savannah and stars in the night sky.
